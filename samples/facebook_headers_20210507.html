<span class="ok"> Nothing to report, all seems OK!
</span>

</strong>
 All, or any, of the values in these headers could be considered insecure:

 Content-Security-Policy
 Remove 'unsafe-inline' and/or 'unsafe-eval' whenever possible.

 Strict-Transport-Security
 Add 'includeSubDomains' and define 'max-age' equal or greater than 31536000 (1 year).


<strong>[4. Empty values]
</strong>
 The following headers have no value (could be equivalent to as if they were not enabled):

<span class="ok"> Nothing to report, all seems OK!
</span>
